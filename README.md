## Simple Stopwatch App

### Three button functionality
#### Start, Stop, and Reset.
Start will start a function that counts based on seconds. Stop will hold your place on the screen. Reset will clear all and end interval. &nbsp;</br>

Flex combined with grid layout make the stopwatch dynamic to any screen.
