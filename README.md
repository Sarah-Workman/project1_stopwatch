## Simple Stopwatch app

### Three button functionality

#### Start, Stop, and Reset.
Start will start a function that counts based on seconds. Stop will hold your timers place on the screen. Reset will clear all and end interval. 

Here are some common markdown samples:

```
console.log('code snippet example');
```

Inline `var inlineCodeExample = 2` example.

> Quote something

**bold** text or _italic_

### Different sized header

- Lots of other options are available with markdown! :)
